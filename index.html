TiltPod No Touch is a smart device that enables users to access custom
apps , similarly to a smart phone. User interface involves controlling
the cursor through the BMA222's accelerometer and clicking on the apps
via the LaunchPad's switches. SW2 enables the user to click on apps and
interact with its features if any, while SW3 allows them to return to
the home screen at any given time. The cursor is shown on the color OLED
display, and is updated in real-time as the user moves the cursor. Two
apps we implemented were a Stocks app and Messaging app, where the user
can search a company's stock value to potentially purchase it, and send
a message resembling a text. These texts in both apps are typed using a
TV IR remote, which are sent to AWS IoT Cloud through the HTTP POST
method. The Stocks app uses a Lambda function to retrieve data about the
company's stocks and returns its ticker, name, price, and exchange when
requested through the HTTP GET method. We process this information and
display the ticker, price, and exchange on the OLED screen. Then, a
button will appear prompting the user to purchase it if desired.

  <div style="display:inline-block;vertical-align:top;flex:1 0 400px;">
    The farthest point from the CC3200 Launchpad is the IR Remote, which simply
    sends its signals through the air. These signals are picked up and converted
    to pulses by the onboard TSOP 311 Receiver, which is connected to the
    CC3200 Launchpad. The onboard switches are also connected to the CC3200
    Launchpad. Our micocontroller will have the responsibility of decoding the
    input from the IR Receiver and switches to determine internal state. Based
    on this internal state, actions to control the OLED Display and send messages
    to AWS IoT are executed. In the case of the Stocks app, a conditional wait
    to obtain a state back from AWS IoT is executed.

  Our entry point for the user begins when they turn on the device, where after
  some wait for initialization the home screen will render. From there, the
  cursor will update depending on the values read by the onboard accelerate
  of the device. Our user interacts with the device by manipulating switches
  which act as touch inputs. Depending on the state of these switches, the
  application changes state, which will propagate to a home screen change. When
  text input is required, the user will interact with the remote which will
  update the onboard buffer of storage asynchronously. The application 
  then becomes a consumer of the data, where it can conditionally retrieve it
  depending on the current app screen. This will then be sent to AWS, where
  AWS IoT routes messages to either a Lambda Service or SNS. AWS will then
  update the device shadow depending on the data sent, where the launchpad can
  again consume and display it, achieving the functionality required for the
  Stocks and Messaging apps.

<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<h2 id="micocontroller-logic">Micocontroller Logic</h2>
<p>Although our original architecture was slightly more complex, our
eventual implementation ended up being much simpler than initially
expected. The basic idea is that on the refresh of the display, all
interfaces are polled and application-specific behavior is determined
and validated. By building on top of the OLED commands implemented from
Lab 2, we could cut down on development time and create functions which
could be called to draw the app screen depending on the state of of
device at the time. This makes switching between screens intuitive from
a developer's perspective, and we can re-use the same state variables to
conditionally send data to AWS IoT.</p>
<p>Control of the state variables is determined by the current status of
the cursor and the state of both of the switches onboard the CC3200
Launchpad. If the user's cursor is over an app icon / region of interest
when either switch is activated, this will register as a button press.
Attached to these button presses are the changes to the state variables
which will get picked up on the next refresh of the screen. This is the
idea behind the asynchronous updates to the IR Receiver buffer since the
main loop can simply read from the buffer when the state is correct,
such as when in the stock app. The message is then conditionally
formatted to the app state and sent to AWS where in the case of the
stock app, it will wait for the Lambda Function to finish execution and
display the data once the Shadow State is updated.</p>
<h2 id="aws-implementation">AWS Implementation</h2>
<p>On the AWS Side, AWS IoT is used to handle all communication from the
Launchpad to the rest of the internet. To implement the functionality in
the Stocks app, an AWS Lambda function is used to access the API Ninjas
Stock API. Due to the way the \verb|g_app_config| struct is set up, our
Launchpad had no clear way to connect to multiple servers at the same
time, so using AWS IoT with routing allows us to bypass this limitation.
Our application uses the way AWS IoT can conditionally trigger by only
reading the variables that were changed since the last shadow topic.
This allows our messaging service and our stock query service to trigger
independently of each other, rather than every time a change to the
state is made. Essentially its a makeshift version of API Gateway.</p>
<h1 id="challenges">Challenges</h1>
<h2
id="touchscreen-interface-was-far-more-difficult-than-expected">Touchscreen
Interface Was Far More Difficult Than Expected</h2>
<p>One major challenge was that we tried to implement a new touch screen
device (HiLetgo ILI9341 2.8" SPI TFT LCD Display Touch Panel) instead of
the OLED display for easier and better user interface experience as it
comes with a built-in tap sensor. Because it uses a different driver
chip, ILI9341, while the OLED uses SSD1351, we could not directly use
the given Adafruit_SSD1351.h file. However, the main issue stemmed from
the fact that these Adafruit driver chip header files are written in C++
with the intent of using them with Arduinos. So, the header files needed
to be manually ported from C++ to C, so that the CC3200 LaunchPad will
be able to compile and run these external files successfully. As the
device uses SPI communication like the OLED, we were able to set up the
connections and port the necessary functions, such as the initialization
sequence, by referencing the Adafruit_SSD1351.h file and using the same
writeCommand() and writeData() functions. However, the challenge came
from testing this communication as the Adafruit_GFX files are used
universally in conjunction with the Adafruit driver chip header files.
But because this also comes in C++ with Arduino-specific language, these
files needed to be customized for the touch screen device as well.
Although the given Adafruit_GFX files were already given in C, there are
commands specific to the OLED's SSD1351 driver chip that are not
directly transferable to the ILI9341 driver chip. Although we tried to
translate and replace those specific commands, the graphic functions
would not show on the device, making it unable to determine where
specifically the problem stems from. Initializing and implementing a new
device takes time and if we had more time, we may have been able to set
it up and use it instead.</p>
<h2 id="aws-struggles">AWS Struggles</h2>
<p>One of the biggest obstacles to achieving our original vision is the
way request and network requests work with the Launchpad. Since our
Launchpad lacks to the credentials to interface with webservers the way
a browser or an API testing service like Postman do, we were extremely
limited with how to build scalable web services. Our original vision was
to use AWS API Gateway since its routing and automatic integration would
be perfect for quickly adding webapp configurations and functionality.
However after configuring a RESTFul API, deploying it and making the
appropriate changes to the Launchpad Code, our micro controller just
couldn't seem to connect. It was most likely a permissions issue, but
there wasn't a clear way to attach API Gateway access to our
certificates, so we ended up pivoting to using AWS IoT Rules
instead.</p>
<h2 id="ti-sdk-documentation-out-of-sync">TI SDK Documentation out of
sync</h2>
<p>Another surprising struggle was serializing JSON responses on the
Launchpad. There was a well documented example on TI's reference online,
but it turns out that the implementation on the documentation, and the
implementation included in the SDK were completely different from each
other, leading to much confusion and trying different lightweight C JSON
libraries. Eventually we realized that the parser was not consuming the
response as we expected it, but it took a very long time to reach that
point, and therefore we ran out of time to add other apps.</p>
<h2 id="paid-api-access">Paid API Access</h2>
<p>And finally, API access to the Twitter has been slashed in recent
years, with no clear messages on what's a paid feature and what's
supported on the free tier. So unfortunately after a while of trying to
make it work, we had to scrap the idea.</p>
<h1 id="future-work">Future Work</h1>
<p>Some additional features we can add include implementing a vertical
or horizontal scroll to realistically mimic a smart device, adding a
music player app through music streaming APIs such as Spotify, and
enhancing user interface by smoothing the app screen transitions and
cursor control. Another feature we could add is a two-way communication
between two LaunchPads so that they send and receive messages on the
Messaging app through AWS IoT. Finally, we could simplify memory usage
by switching to an MQTT protocol for two-way communication between the
board and AWS IoT.</p>
